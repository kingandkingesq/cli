Summary
    These functions simplify creating and reclaming temporary directories and files.
    Typically a temporary directory or file is created with a random name and deleted 
    in an EXIT trap. These functions formalize this flow. 
    
    The name of temp directories or files will be randomly generated by mktemp. The
    template will contain the subshell pid so the subshell that created the file can
    be infered from its name.
